## gtrick.pyg.CorrectAndSmooth

!!! note
    `CorrectAndSmooth` has been implemented in PyG. You can use it by `from torch_geometric.nn import CorrectAndSmooth` or use gtrick to manage all tricks.

    Since the two is the same, you can refer to the PyG document: [torch_geometric.nn.CorrectAndSmooth](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.models.CorrectAndSmooth).
